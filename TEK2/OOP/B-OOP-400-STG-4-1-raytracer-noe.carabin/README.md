# Raytracer - OOP

### your CPU goes BRRRRRR!

---

```bash
./raytracer bonus/assets/scenes/scene1.cfg > output_image.ppm
```
Or to run it on 10 threads :
```bash
./raytracer bonus/assets/scenes/scene1.cfg -t 10 > output_image.ppm
```
Useful tip : Pass the -p flag to get realtime percentage completion updates in CLI. That way you can track performances and ETA easily.
```bash
./raytracer assets/scenes/scene1.cfg -t 10 > output_image.ppm
```
