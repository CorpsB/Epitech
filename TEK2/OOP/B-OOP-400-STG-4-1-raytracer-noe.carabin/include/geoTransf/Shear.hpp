/**
 * @file Shear.hpp
 * @brief Declares the geometric shear transformation primitive for raytracing scenes.
 * @author Thibaut Louis
 * @version 1.0
 * @date 2025-05
 *
 * @details
 * The Shear class allows applying a linear shear transformation to any primitive.
 * It uses a 3Ã—3 shear matrix defined by six coefficients to distort space along specific axes.
 * This transformation is applied during intersection and normal calculations.
