# NanoTekSpice - A Digital Logic Simulator

## Description

**NanoTekSpice** is a logic circuit simulator that processes digital electronic components based on Boolean logic.  
It builds a graph of components from a configuration file, injects values, and simulates the circuit over time.  

This project is written in **C++** and follows object-oriented principles to model electronic components and their interactions.

## Installation

To compile the project, use the provided **Makefile**:
make


This will generate the `nanotekspice` binary.  
To clean up the build files, use:
make clean # Removes object files make fclean # Removes object files and the binary


Alternatively, **CMake** can be used to compile the project.

## Usage

Run the simulator by passing a circuit configuration file:
./nanotekspice <circuit_file.nts>


Once started, the program enters an interactive mode, where you can use the following commands:

### Commands

- `exit` – Closes the program.
- `display` – Prints the current tick and the values of all inputs and outputs.
- `<input>=<value>` – Sets an input's value (possible values: `0`, `1`, `U` for undefined).
- `simulate` – Simulates a tick of the circuit.
- `loop` – Continuously runs the simulation (simulate, display, simulate, ...) until interrupted with `CTRL+C`.

Each command is entered after the prompt (`> `).

When printing values:
- `0` = Low signal
- `1` = High signal
- `U` = Undefined state

## Configuration File Format

A configuration file (`.nts`) defines the circuit using two sections:

### `.chipsets:`
Declares components, e.g.:
.chipsets: 
input i0 
input i1 
4081 and0 
output out


### `.links:`
Defines connections between components:
.links:
i0:1
and0:1
i1:1
and0:2
and0:3
out:1


Lines starting with `#` are comments.

## Error Handling

If an error occurs, the program exits with **status code 84** and prints an error message to `stderr`.  
Common errors include:
- Invalid syntax in the circuit file.
- Unknown component types.
- Duplicate component names.
- Missing necessary components.

## Example Execution

$ ./nanotekspice example.nts
a=1 b=0 simulate display tick: 1 input(s): a: 1 b: 0 output(s): s: 1 exit


The program should never crash due to uncaught exceptions, segmentation faults, or infinite loops.

### Help Option (`-h`)

Running the program with `-h` displays this help message:

$ ./nanotekspice -h Usage: ./nanotekspice <circuit_file.nts> Simulates a digital circuit using Boolean logic.

Commands: exit Close the program.
display Show the current state of all inputs/outputs.
<input>=<value> Set an input value (0, 1, U).
simulate Run one simulation tick.
loop Run simulation continuously until interrupted.
